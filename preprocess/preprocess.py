            # by providing weights or oversampling during DataLoader creation, but not necessarily
            # save the *normalized* images.

            # Given the directory structure `data/processed/train/def_front`, etc.,
            # it implies that the preprocessed images *are* saved there.
            # So, I will save the *resized* images to these directories.
